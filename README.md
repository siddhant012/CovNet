# CovNet
A highly optimized deep learning library inspired from keras written in numpy in python for implementing CNN's and NN's. It have tried to include most of the practices and functionalities being used in deep learning today like optimizers,regularizers,various layers,activations,losses,initializers,learning rate schedulers,metrics,augmentations,pre-processing tools,model summary etc. It is not however as fast as keras (about 70% as fast) because it does not take full advantage of parallel computing and GPU. Future updates may include RNN's and functionalities like early stopping etc. I am presently exploring the possibility of using CuPy , cython etc so as to get a speedup.
