# CovNet
A fast, light weight, fully-featured deep learning library, written from scratch using numpy in python, for implementing CNN's and NN's. Includes features like optimizers, regularizers, various layers, activations, losses, initializers, learning rate schedulers, metrics, augmentations, pre-processing tools, model summary etc. Future updates may include using libraries like CuPy or Cython to increase speed through parallel computing and increased GPU utilization.

## Supports:
###### Activation Functions : Sigmoid, Relu, Leaky Rely, Linear, Softmax, Tanh 
###### Optimizers : Adam, RMS Prop, Momentum
###### LR Decay : Exponential decay, Normal decay, Square root decay, Stair-case decay, Linear decay
###### Regularizers : L2, L1
###### Initializers : Zeros, Ones, Constants, Random normal, Random Normal, He normal, He uniform, Glorot Normal (Xavier's distribution), Glorot Uniform (Xavier's distribution)
###### Layers : Convolutional, Pooling, Fully Connected, Dropout, Flatten, Batch Normalization
###### Pre-processing tools : one-hot encoding, normalize, standardize, shuffle
###### Misc : Print Model Summary, Evaluation, Live training information, Gradient Checking
